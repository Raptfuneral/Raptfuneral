### Hi there 👋 👨‍🎓
I'm an SDET graduate with experience in manual software testing and coding using JAVA programming language. 
  ## 💻 👨‍💼
-  I have performed test executions using Selenium WebDriver for parallel testing (Selenium-Grid, LambdaTest), Page Object Model pattern, 
  Git for versions control, Jenkins as a CI tool, and TestNG and Gradle configuration. 
-  Additional experience in tracking and reporting bugs using JIRA and creating test cases/suites using Zephyr. 
-  Extensive practice in smoke testing, regression testing, UI testing, black box testing, ad-hoc testing, and gray box testing.
  ## 👨‍💼 + 💻 = 👍
- A solid work pattern incorporating relevant skills at every stage in the SDLC to identify issues as early as possible 
  through an agile methodology approach.
